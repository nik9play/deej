# process names are case-insensitive
# you can use 'master' to indicate the master channel, or a list of process names to create a group
# you can use 'mic' to control your mic input level (uses the default recording device)
# you can use 'deej.unmapped' to control all apps that aren't bound to any slider (this ignores master, system, mic and device-targeting sessions)
# windows only - you can use 'deej.current' to control the currently active app (whether full-screen or not)
# windows only - you can use 'deej.current.fullscreen' to control the currently active full-screen app
# windows only - you can use a device's full name, i.e. "Speakers (Realtek High Definition Audio)", to bind it. this works for both output and input devices
# windows only - you can use 'system' to control the "system sounds" volume
# you can use '!processname.exe' to exclude specific processes from deej.current and deej.current.fullscreen targets on that slider
# important: slider indexes start at 0, regardless of which analog pins you're using!
slider_mapping:
  0: firefox.exe
  1: discord.exe
  2:
    - deej.current.fullscreen
    - "!explorer.exe"          # exclude Windows Explorer from this slider
    - "!dwm.exe"               # exclude Desktop Window Manager
  3: master
  4: mic

# Examples of exclusion usage:
# slider_mapping:
#   0:
#     - deej.current           # control currently active window
#     - "!explorer.exe"        # except Windows Explorer
#     - "!dwm.exe"             # and Desktop Window Manager
#   1:
#     - deej.current.fullscreen
#     - "!applicationframehost.exe"  # exclude UWP container
#   2:
#     - firefox.exe
#     - chrome.exe
#   3:
#     - deej.current           # different slider, different exclusions
#     - "!spotify.exe"         # don't control Spotify on this slider
#
# Note: Exclusions (!) only affect deej.current and deej.current.fullscreen
# They do NOT affect:
# - Direct process name mappings (like "2: firefox.exe" above)
# - deej.unmapped target
# - Other sliders (each slider has its own exclusion list)

# set this to true if you want the controls inverted (i.e. top is 0%, bottom is 100%)
